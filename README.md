Anmu
======
So First things first I have not decided on a license yet so If you wish to change my code email me at yamuchan@gmail.com

Amnu is going to be an Operating System, and my Goal for Anmu Is for it to startup a terminal and execute basic commands such as 'echo' or 'clear', and finally to traverse through the file system with ease.
